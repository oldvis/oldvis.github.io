# How is the dataset maintained?

The mission of the OldVis project is to create a digital library with as many old visualizations on the web as possible.
The construction of the old visualization dataset cannot be done once and for all because the digital libraries we have used are continuously updating.
An old visualization that is not available on the web today may become digitized and available on the web tomorrow.
**Thus, the construction of the old visualization dataset is a continuous process.**

The latest dataset of old visualizations can be found at [oldvis/dataset](https://github.com/oldvis/dataset).
The [contribution guideline of oldvis/dataset](https://github.com/oldvis/dataset/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) lists steps to contribute updates to the dataset in different scenarios.
