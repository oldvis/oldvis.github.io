# Processor

We have two Python packages to process digital library querying results:

- [libprocess](https://github.com/oldvis/libprocess): a collection of queriers for querying general-purpose massive digital libraries.
- [libquery_extensions](https://github.com/oldvis/libquery_extensions): an extended collection of queriers for querying online resources related to old visualizations.
