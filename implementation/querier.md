# Querier

We have two Python packages to query data from digital libraries:

- [libquery](https://github.com/oldvis/libquery): a collection of queriers for querying general-purpose massive digital libraries.
- [libquery_extensions](https://github.com/oldvis/libquery_extensions): an extended collection of queriers for querying online resources related to old visualizations.
